## Inferring Types in tsio

While tsio automates the process of inferring types for actions and listeners, users may occasionally require access to their contract's types for various purposes. tsio offers utility types designed to facilitate the inference of contract actions and listeners effortlessly.

### Utility Types

#### Actions

Infer actions functions

```typescript filename="types.ts" copy
type PostActions = InferContractActionFunction<typeof postContract>
type CreatePostActionHandler = PostActions['createPost']

const createPostHandler: CreatePostActionHandler = (input, callback) => {
  //
}
```

#### Listeners

On the other hand, the Listeners utility type allows users to infer the types of listeners specified in their contract. This type provides visibility into the data payloads received by listeners, empowering developers to handle incoming events with precision and accuracy.

```typescript filename="types.ts" copy
type Listeners = InferContractListeners<Contract>
```
